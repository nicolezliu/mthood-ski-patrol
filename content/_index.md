## About Us
The **Mt. Hood Ski Patrol** is a member-driven organization dedicated to rescue, emergency care, and public safety for the Mt. Hood recreational community.

We are composed of nearly **200 volunteer patrollers**, all dedicated to providing quality rescue and emergency care to alpine and nordic skiers and snowboarders at the following areas:

- Mt. Hood Meadows  
- Mt. Hood Skibowl  
- Summit Ski Area  
- Timberline  
- Teacup Lake Nordic Ski Area  

Primarily, we support **weekend and holiday operations** at four area ski resorts and along developed backcountry and nordic trails.  
At two of these resorts, our support extends **year-round** to summer skiers and mountain bikers.

We also boast nearly **100 mountain-host volunteers** who provide guest services and other assistance at Timberline and Skibowl.
